[{"title":"Paris","link":"/Paris_France/","subtitle":"#1 in Best Places to Visit in Europe","description":"The City of Light draws millions of visitors every year with its unforgettable ambiance. Of course, the divine cuisine and vast art collections deserve some of the credit as well. The gentle River Seine rambles through the city, flanked by stately museums, centuries-old churches, and blocks of Rococo- and Neoclassic-design architecture, further enhanced by cascading trees and glowing streetlamps. Peppering the Seine's cobbled walks and graceful bridges are impossibly chic Parisians, probably on their way to the market, cafe or cinema.\nContaining world-class museums, fashion, cuisine and an atmosphere all its own, Paris is also a city of \"many splendors,\" as Ernest Hemingway recalled in his memoir, \"A Moveable Feast.\" Visit the beloved Musée d'Orsay, shop the biggest designers on the Champs Élysées or hit the boutiques in Le Marais, take in the view atop the Eiffel Tower, or even plan a day trip to Versailles Palace. But don't miss out on the simple pleasure of meandering the marvelous arrondissements (districts), or snacking on street crepes either.","monthsToVisit":"The best time to visit Paris is from June to August and September to October. Both summer and fall have its ups and downs. From June to August the weather in Paris is just about parfait (perfect). Average highs are in the high 70s and there are long days of sunshine. Unfortunately, summer is also the most crowded time – and the most expensive. For lower travel rates and significantly shorter lines at attractions, plan a visit in the fall. The seasonal foliage is known to stun, though the city's spring blooms are pretty famous too. If a travel deal is all that you're after, a visit during the winter will surely shave off travel expenses. Keep in mind though that Paris is one of the most visited cities in the world, seeing upward of 30 million travelers yearly. So no matter what time you visit, there will always be tourists and some crowds. \n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":"There's this idea that Parisians stick up their noses to Americans – that they're notoriously unfriendly and even rude. This is a stereotype. Like anywhere you visit, there's a chance you may run into friendly and unfriendly locals during your journey. A great way to bridge the cultural divide is to learn a little bit of the language.\nWhile many Parisians know English (especially in tourist areas and hotels), a little effort from your end really can go a long way. Pleasantries are highly regarded in French culture. A \"bonjour\" (hello or good day) or \"bonsoir\" (good evening) here and there will not only show that you're trying on their turf, which the French appreciate, but enhance your own cultural experience. \"Merci\" is thank you and \"s'il vous plaît\" is please. If you're at a loss for words, politely ask the waiter or shop attendant \"Pouvez-vous m'aider?\" (Can you help me?) or \"Parlez-vous anglais?\" (Do you speak English?). Another helpful phrase: \"Excusez-moi\"(Pardon or excuse me). If you are introduced to French people in social situations, stick to a handshake unless the person you are meeting initiates the les bises, or the greeting where people lightly kiss each other on the cheek once or twice. If you aren't comfortable, merely stick out your hand for a handshake.\nSpeaking of trying to blend in... Paris is one of the most fashionable cities in the world. Everyone from Coco Chanel to Yves Saint Laurent and Christian Lacroix got their start in fashion in Paris – and their influence remains. Blend in with the locals by dressing stylishly, though don't feel pressure to dress to the nines. Parisians do dress casually but wearing items such as activewear, sweatshirts, running shoes, flip flops or even some shorts (denim cut-offs, for example) around town is not commonplace here as it is in the U.S. Parisians like to keep it simple and chic, opting for a black leather bag over logo-ladden designer bags and incorporating soft-spoken color palettes into their wardrobe. You won't see a whole lot of French people wearing neon. \nFrance uses the euro, and major credit cards are accepted at most establishments in Paris. Since the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates, be sure to check what the current exchange rate is before you go. Keep in mind the exchange rate when you tip and make purchases. Some smaller bakeries or bistros may only take cash, though, so keep some euros on hand just in case. Most restaurants and cafes will include a 10 to 15 percent service charge (service compris) on the bill. You can leave some additional change for exceptional service, if you wish. Taxi drivers tend to expect a 5 to 10 percent tip, though usually rounding to the nearest euro or two will often suffice. You may also encounter fees to use the bathroom in some restaurants and bathroom attendants in many bars in Paris. If the fee isn't collected ahead of the use of the facilities, it's polite to leave 50 cents to a euro for the attendants."},{"title":"Yellowstone","link":"/Yellowstone_National_Park_WY/","subtitle":"#1 in Best Family Vacations","description":"With dramatic peaks and pristine lakes, Yellowstone National Park is an outdoor enthusiast's paradise. Multicolored pools swirl around hot springs; verdant forests weave past expansive meadows; and volatile geysers launch streams of steaming water toward the sky. With so much unspoiled natural beauty, it's no wonder why everyone suspected John Colter (a scout for explorers Lewis and Clark) was embellishing when he first described Yellowstone's geothermal curiosities in 1807. Nowadays, there's no doubt that the park is indeed extraordinary. While you traverse its 3,000-plus square miles of mountains, canyons, geysers and waterfalls, be prepared to share the trails with permanent residents like buffalo, elk and sometimes even grizzlies. \nAlthough Yellowstone attracts more than 4 million visitors every year, chances are – unless you spend your entire trip at Old Faithful – you won't see much of them. Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres creep from the northwest corner of Wyoming into the edges of Idaho and Montana, offering plenty of untouched territory to explore. Carve out a day or two to take in the view at Yellowstone Lake and Mammoth Hot Springs. But save some time for the trails through lesser-known regions, like the hot springs of the West Thumb Geyser Basin and the untamed wildlife dotting the Lewis River Channel and Dogshead Loop. While the sheer number of trails and wildlife-watching opportunities may seem daunting at first, remember: You can always come back.","monthsToVisit":"The best times to visit Yellowstone National Park are from April to May and between September and November. These seasons offer mild weather and fewer crowds. July and August are the most popular months to visit: The kids are out of school, and the weather is warm enough to sleep outside. However, this park is no stranger to the cold. Temperatures have been known to drop into the 30s even in the summer. During the winter, expect a wide range of temps, spanning from subzero digits to the high 30s. Don't let that stop you: There's nothing quite like seeing plumes of steam rise from beneath a thick blanket of snow and ice.\n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":""},{"title":"Rome","link":"/Rome_Italy/","subtitle":"#1 in Best Affordable Winter Vacations","description":"Rome, the city of seven hills, enjoyed a mythic beginning. Romulus and Remus – twin brothers who were nursed by a she-wolf and fathered by a war god – reportedly founded the Eternal City. And although historians are a little skeptical about this epic entry into the world, most travelers are absolutely certain that there is something magical about Rome. Whether it's the mystery of nearby Vatican City or the ghosts of the Colosseum, an afternoon caffè on Piazza Navona or a piled-high plate of pasta at a trattoria, Roma is sure to enchant.\nItaly's capital city, Rome is also known for a history that dates back to the eras of Octavian, Julius Caesar and Hadrian, among others. Left behind are structures like the Pantheon, the Roman Forum and dozens of churches, among other historic gems. Art enthusiasts will relish the trove of art housed at the Vatican Museums, and foodies will enjoy the splendid Italian fare, not to mention the gelato. And though its momentous past is the focus for many vacationers, Rome is also a fast-paced, modern and relevant city, with gleaming designer storefronts, sleek hotels and cutting-edge restaurants.","monthsToVisit":"The best time to visit Rome is from October to April when most of the tourist crowds have dissipated and room rates are lower. Although you'll need a warm coat, weather this time of year hardly ever dips below freezing. For warmer weather – without throngs of tourists and the sweltering humidity – come in May or September. High average temperatures flit between the mid-70s and the lower 80s.\n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":"Trying to look like a resident isn't difficult, especially if your own wardrobe is filled with high-end designer labels.

Since the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates, be sure to check what the current exchange rate is before you go. Major credit cards are accepted at most restaurants and shops. \nThe official language in Rome is Italian, and while it's advisable to learn a few phrases – ciao for hello; addio for goodbye; per favore for please, among others – most tourist-facing institutions, whether hotels or attractions, will have people that can communicate in English."},{"title":"Tahiti","link":"/Tahiti_French_Polynesia/","subtitle":"#1 in Best Islands in the World","description":"Miles of shoreline, dozens of resorts, French cuisine to die for – Tahiti has all the makings of a honeymoon destination. But beach bums often pass over Tahiti's sands in favor of Bora Bora's ivory shores. Despite its idyllic reputation and accessibility, Tahiti is more of an off-the-beaten-path stop than a romantic getaway. However, that doesn't mean Tahiti deserves to be ignored.\nLeafy forests sit beside sandy shores, French crêpes are served alongside Tahitian poisson cru (raw fish). If there ever was a place that embodies the beautiful duality of the French Polynesian archipelago, it's Tahiti. Here, the quirky, often chaotic atmosphere of the island's capital, Papeete, rubs elbows with uncorrupted natural beauty. In fact, Tahiti – the largest of French Polynesia's 118 islands – is often referred to as two separate islands despite them being joined by a tiny land bridge. Tahiti Nui is the larger, northern section where Papeete can be found. Tahiti Iti (the smaller half) is less accessible, although many visitors make the trek here for a taste of seclusion. Just note that spending a week on either part of Tahiti will cost you quite a chunk of change. But travelers agree that the warm waters, the lush jungles and the luxurious resorts are worth the splurge.","monthsToVisit":"The best time to visit Tahiti is between May and October. Although the temperatures are balmy year-round, Tahiti's winter season enjoys less humidity. Tahiti really only experiences two distinct seasons: Winter brings less rain and pleasant temperatures while the summertime – November through April – can be unbearably hot and humid, not to mention rainy. But regardless of when you travel, you can expect hotel rates to be high. \n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":"French is the official language of French Polynesia, though you'll find that many locals (especially those who work in tourism) speak English. However, it never hurts to brush up on a few common phrases – like \"bonjour\" (\"hello\") and \"merci\" (\"thank you\") – or bring along a French-to-English dictionary or phrasebook. Also, bear in mind that for most Tahitians, English is a second language; be patient and courteous when conversing with locals. You may also hear bits and pieces of Tahitian, the local island language, but most residents will promptly switch to French or English when communicating with you.\nThe currency is the French Polynesia Franc (XPF); the exchange rate fluctuates, so be sure to check it before you go.\nTahiti is a safe place for tourists. Generally speaking, there are only a couple of dangers to watch out for: pickpockets in Pape'ete and moray eels in the coral reefs on scuba dives. Most visitors soon discover that Tahiti is warm and welcoming to foreigners. In fact, locals have a philosophy called \"aita pea pea\" (which translates to: \"not to worry\"), which results in a very laid-back and affable culture. Don't be surprised if you hear absolute strangers greet you on the street. "},{"title":"London","link":"/London_England/","subtitle":"#1 in Best Spring Vacations","description":"The English writer Samuel Johnson famously said, \"You find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.\" More than two centuries have passed since Johnson's era, but his words still ring true. Life in London is nothing short of invigorating, and travelers find that one visit isn't enough to experience everything this two-millennia-old city has to offer.\nHere, the antiquated clasps hands with the contemporary. You'll find the historic Tower of London and the avant-garde Tate Modern both considered must-sees. Shakespeare's sonnets are still being uttered by actors who don modern garb. Londoners most certainly still respect the royals, but they also jam to the likes of Arctic Monkeys and Adele. And while they still praise the power of tea, they now make room for some Starbucks here and there, and pressed juice too. A current leader in everything from politics and banking to fashion and music, London's culture compass is always attuned to what's next.","monthsToVisit":"The best time to visit London is March through May when the temperatures are mild and the city's parks are green and blooming. However, late spring – along with summer – is also prime tourist season, and hotel and flight prices reflect the surge. You're more likely to find airfare and accommodation deals in the fall and winter though you'll also encounter chilly temperatures. December in London is also an incredibly popular place to be during the holidays, so expect the streets to be crowded with both English and international tourists. And no matter when you travel, you should pack an umbrella: London is notorious for experiencing misty days and showers year-round. Another thing to keep in mind: it's nearly impossible to escape crowds in London. Along with being one of the biggest cities in Europe, London is one of the most popular destinations to visit in the world, so no matter what time of year you go, you're bound to run into lots of tourists.\n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":"Aside from a few select phrases and words, Americans find the city accessible because of London's official English language. British people are very polite and quite friendly to tourists, so don't be afraid to ask for directions if you're lost. More often than not Londoners are happy to point you in the right direction, or even offer a recommendation about their city. But keep in mind that the British like order. There is no better example than how you are expected to behave on the Tube (London's subway). Make sure to stand to the right when going up or down escalators. \nThe other side to the Brits, especially among the young adults, is their penchant for drinking. Unlike coffee shops in the U.S., pubs are the prime watering hole for the Brits. Most pubs serve meals and are open the majority of the day, so don't be alarmed if you see people walking in with young children. Once 5 o'clock rolls around, the hunger for a post-work pick me up is rampant in London, and pubs, as well as bars, tend to fill up throughout the week. Expect to see hordes of people congregating outside pubs in the warmer months and some stumbling out nightly at around 9 p.m. Also, since London is one of the fashion capitals of the world, you'll see locals dressed to the nines throughout the city but especially around Oxford Street, where many fashion houses and publications are located. If you ever wanted to go the extra mile with your style game, London is the place to do it.\nLondon's official currency is the British pound. Since the pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates, be sure to check what the current exchange rate is before you go. As for tipping, some restaurants and cafes may add a service charge to the bill, upward of 12 percent. If a service charge is not allotted, it's customary to tip between 10 and 15 percent, especially if you're in a restaurant. If you're drinking at a pub or wine bar, tipping is discretionary. And in a cab, tip the driver to the nearest pound or about 10 percent of the cost. Major credit cards are accepted at most restaurants and shops."},{"title":"Phuket","link":"/Phuket_Thailand/","subtitle":"#2 in Best Beaches in the World","description":"Pure white sands, aquamarine waters and limestone cliffs await travelers who visit Thailand's southwestern island of Phuket. Surrounded by the Andaman Sea and about an hour by plane from Bangkok, this island is a little piece of paradise, which comes with a relatively low price tag for everything from its accommodations to spa treatments and boat tours. But along with its tropical appeal, Phuket beckons to travelers wanting to experience its flavorful cuisine (think: lemongrass, lime leaves, chillies) and its rich culture, heavily influenced by its reigning religion: Buddhism. \nAnd although the island's beaches and tourism operators have bounced back from the 2004 tsunami, which hammered its western coast and tragically claimed thousands of lives, it remembers the past with memorials and a better warning system, should the area once again come under threat. ","monthsToVisit":"The best time to visit Phuket is between November and April when weather conditions are ideal for beach activities, such as swimming and boating.

The sheikh of Abu Dhabi acts as president of the Federal Supreme Council (both the UAE's legislative and executive body), while the sheikh of Dubai fills the role of vice president. Although Abu Dhabi serves as the official capital of the UAE, Dubai has long been the emirates' commercial and financial hub.\nBut Dubai wasn't always the economic powerhouse it is today.

Dubai's population features citizens of 200 different nationalities, and each has left its own imprint on daily life. However, the dominant religion here is Islam, and Muslim culture greatly impacts Dubai's society. As a result, visitors are encouraged to dress modestly here – that means no exposed chests, thighs or midriffs – and alcohol is not commonly found outside of international hotels and restaurants. Those who visit during Ramadan (the Islamic month of fasting) are encouraged to refrain from eating or drinking in public places.\nDespite its size, Dubai has earned a reputation as being one of the safest places in the Middle East. The UAE remains removed from the political and religious conflicts taking place in other parts of the Middle East. Women visiting Dubai should also feel safe to move about freely.

Much of the activity revolves around Las Ramblas, a series of narrow streets and alleys packed with restaurants, nightclubs and a vibrant pedestrian market. But you should also take a tour of Antoni Gaudí's masterpieces; Gaudí is responsible for sites like Casa Milà, Casa Batlló and La Sagrada Familia. You also shouldn't miss out on the eclectic shopping scene and the region's exquisite food and wine. You see why we suggest a week vacation?","monthsToVisit":"The best time to visit the Barcelona is from May to June when balmy temperatures in the low to mid-70s mesh with a flurry of festivals that trumpet the advent of summer. The actual summertime is sticky with humidity – locals leave their beloved city in droves to catch a breeze somewhere else. They come back for the fall when the average highs drop back into the 70s. Winter is mild compared to other Spanish destinations, with highs in the high 50s. And while coming during the spring may seem like smart idea for avoiding crowds, April sees frequent showers, which may put a literal damper on sightseeing plans (most of Barcelona's top attractions are experienced outside). Keep in mind that no matter what time of the year you'll visit, there will be tourist crowds: Barcelona is the most-visited city in Spain.\n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":"Barcelona is part of the Spanish province of Catalonia, making its culture a little different from what you'd experience in Madrid, Seville or Granada. The most noticeable difference is the language. In Barcelona, both Spanish and Catalan are official languages. It's important to know that Catalan is not a dialect of Spanish. The language was derived from Latin during the occupation of the Romans several thousands of years ago. While in Barcelona, you'll see street and roadway signs in both Catalan and Spanish as well as some restaurant menus. As such, Barcelona residents tend to be bilingual. But don't fret about getting lost in translation in two languages. Residents don't expect tourists to know Catalan (the language is only spoken in the Catalonia region as well as in Valencia, the Balearic Islands, the country of Andorra and Alghero in Sardinia, Italy), so if you know some Spanish and would like to practice it, you won't run into any language confusion. However, considering Barcelona is one of the most visited cities in Europe, you will likely find English speaking residents in hotels and tourist areas.\nIt's also important to know that Catalonia is an autonomous province in Spain, and you may find that some residents identify more as Catalans than Spaniards (the Catalonia flag can be found all over in Barcelona). The reason residents keep to their Catalan roots so tightly lies in a lifelong struggle for Catalonia to keep its culture from going extinct. When Spain initially became a country, Catalonia, which was incorporated, was subjected to significant cultural changes when Spanish was made the official language of both the court and literature. Over time, the province was able to reincorporate Catalan back into the literary culture, but during the Spanish Civil War in the mid-1930s, nationalist dictator Francisco Franco rose to power, took over democratic Spain and heavily restricted the expression of Catalonian culture.  When Franco died, Catalonia was able to revive its language (it was banned under Franco) and become autonomous once again. Today, there is a movement in Barcelona (Catalonia's capital) to make Catalonia independent of Spain, but under the Spanish constitution, it's not possible.\nBarcelona's official currency is the euro (EUR). Since the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates often, be sure to check what the current exchange rate is before you go. Major credit cards are accepted at most restaurants and shops. Like the rest of Spain, tipping is not common in Barcelona. Depending on where you dine, a service charge may be added to your bill. However, if you do want to tip, 10 percent is more than sufficient. Also similar to the rest of Spain, Catalans eat late and party even later. Restaurants are typically open for lunch between 1 and 4 p.m. and for dinner from 8 to 11 p.m. However, that doesn't mean all restaurants abide by those hours. Because Barcelona is such a popular tourist destination, you are likely to find establishments that don't close in the afternoon between lunch and dinner, so you should be able to find somewhere to grab a meal if you're hungry. For locals, dinner usually starts at 9 p.m. at the earliest, going out starts at 12 a.m. and clubs stay open until 5 or 6 a.m. If you're meeting a Catalan in a social situation, don't be alarmed if they reach out to kiss you on the cheek. Dos besos, or two kisses, one on each cheek, is the equivalence of a handshake or hug when greeting friends or meeting new people. If you are uncomfortable, simply reach out your hand when meeting someone new."},{"title":"Yosemite","link":"/Yosemite_CA/","subtitle":"#2 in Best National Parks in the World","description":"One of California's most formidable natural landscapes, Yosemite National Park features nearly 1,200 square miles of sheer awe: towering waterfalls, millennia-old Sequoia trees, striking, daunting cliff faces and some of the most unique rock formations in the United States. But despite its enormous size, most of the tourist activity takes place within the 8-square-mile area of Yosemite Valley. Here you'll find the park's most famous landmarks – Half Dome and El Capitan – as well as excellent hiking trails through the natural monuments. Even inexperienced hikers can enjoy Yosemite: Guided tours and climbing lessons are available from local adventure outfitters. Just don't expect to experience it by yourself. Like so many other American tourist destinations, crowds are the biggest obstacles to an enjoyable Yosemite vacation – approximately 4 million people visit each year. But if you go at the right time (and start your day a little earlier than usual), Mother Nature's wonders will reveal themselves to you in a miraculous and serene way.","monthsToVisit":"The best times to visit Yosemite are May and September, when the park is accessible but not too crowded. It's important to know that many roads and trails in Yosemite are closed for the majority of the year due to snow. Snow can come as early as October and arrives in full force in November, typically remaining until March. But just because the snowstorms stop in March doesn't necessarily mean closed parts of the park suddenly swing their doors open. Depending on conditions, all seasonally closed roads and trails don't open till May or June.Seasonal park closures are precisely why so many travelers visit during the summer months, making it the park's busiest time of year (think packed trails, road traffic, sky-high hotel rates and more). To avoid this, the best time to visit is before or after the summer crowds come, which is typically late May and September. Late May and early June is the best time to view waterfalls, roaring from freshly melted snow, and September offers cooler temperatures ideal for hiking (summer temps can reach the 80s). If the only time you can visit is during the summer, be sure to book several months in advance. Campsites are known to reach capacity the moment they become available for booking. If you're looking for a bargain on accommodations, winter is the best time to visit Yosemite. \n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":""},{"title":"Santorini","link":"/Santorini_Greece/","subtitle":"#1 in Best Greek Islands","description":"A massive volcanic eruption around 1650 B.C. forced the center of what was then a single island to implode and succumb to the sea. Some say that this was the original home of the lost city of Atlantis, which long ago disappeared into the ocean's depths. Whatever remains of this mythological metropolis is now guarded by beautiful beaches and stately whitewashed homes. Today, Santorini consists of two inhabited islands and several islets. Most visitors spend their time on Thira (the archipelago's largest island), which is home to Santorini's major towns, including Fira and Oia. Sleepy Thirassia makes for a relaxing daytrip too. And don't count out the quieter islands: Nea Kameni and Palea Kameni are worth exploring.\nYour first order of business in Santorini is to hit the colorful beaches – the black and red sands make for a memorable visit. Next up, indulge in the archaeological delights of the impressively preserved Ancient Akrotiri or hike to Ancient Thera to see the ruins of three empires, including the Romans. From there, catch a breathtaking view of the caldera, a brilliant turquoise pool of water that serves as the nucleus for the varied isles of this archipelago. Some would say you only need a day to enjoy these islands' charms (they are a popular port of call for cruise ships), but to really drink in all Santorini has to offer, you'll need a few days to a week. Then you'll have plenty of time to learn there's more to these comely dots of the Cyclades than meets the eye.","monthsToVisit":"The best time to visit Santorini is from September to October and April to May when the weather is warm and the crowds are scarce. Like all of the Cyclades, Santorini welcomes the most visitors during the summer, so you'll need to make your reservations months in advance if you plan on visiting anytime from June through August. Looking for a bargain? Try winter, when room rates tend to plummet. Keep in mind that this season's average highs only reach the 50s (not good for sunbathing) and the region sees plenty of precipitation. However, all that rain does make for a very flowery (and warm) spring season. Crowds will be at a low in the spring as well, though tourists will begin invading the islands come May.\n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":"Greek is the official language, though considering the large influx of visitors the island receives (as many as 10,000 cruise ship tourists alone come ashore daily), you're more likely to run into English-speaking Greeks than not, especially in tourist areas. Understanding body language here though is key. Be very aware of your gestures. For example, using the thumb and index finger to signal \"OK\" is offensive, as is holding up your palm to anyone. If you want to wave goodbye, make sure your palm is facing you. As for indicating nodding your head to indicate 'yes' and shaking your head to indicate 'no.' Greeks do it differently. A slight downward means 'yes' while a slight upward nod means 'no.' These gestures are often subtle and quick, making it hard for foreigners to understand. The best thing to do is avoid trying to communicate with gestures here to avoid getting lost in body language translation.\nGreeks are known to be very friendly, especially when meeting new people. When meeting a Greek in a social situation, shaking hands is customary. Two kisses, one exchanged on each cheek, is the norm when with acquaintances. Greeks tend to be very open and become deeply engaged when in conversation. They have also been known to get personal, fast. If you're uncomfortable with the dialogue, such as talking about sensitive subjects such as politics or if you're being asked too personal questions, simply try to change the subject. Lateness is also common here. If you have plans with Greeks, expect them to be at least 15 minutes late. \nShorts and T-shirts are acceptable when walking around the towns or the beaches, some of which are clothing optional. Dress continues to be casual even in restaurants, but Greeks tend to dress up a little more nicely when dining out in the evenings. Other than on the beach, never waltz into a restaurant or public space in your bathing suit or barefoot, even along a beachfront promenade. \nSantorini's currency is the euro. Since the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates, be sure to check what the current exchange rate is before you go. Major credit cards are accepted at most restaurants and shops. When eating at a restaurant, a service charge may be included. As such, tipping isn't commonplace. Also, keep in mind the plumbing system in Santorini is not stellar – when at a hotel or restaurant, throw any used toilet paper in the waste basket rather than flushing it down the toilet to avoid any potentially embarrassing flooding situations."},{"title":"Maui","link":"/Maui_HI/","subtitle":"#1 in Best Places to Visit in November","description":"Maui is not nearly as large as the Big Island, nor is it as small as Lanai, as bustling as Oahu or as quiet as Kauai. For many Hawaii vacationers, Maui is just right – offering a taste of just about everything the Aloha State has to offer, from impressive wildlife to intriguing history and culture. While on a visit here, you can shimmy alongside professional hula dancers, golf along coastal fairways, snorkel alongside five different types of sea turtles or simply lounge along some of Hawaii's most notable beaches.\nOne of the archipelago's most popular tourism spots, Maui can be found sandwiched between the Big Island and the much tinier Molokai. Maui is divided into five distinct regions: Many travelers base themselves along the coasts of South Maui (home to the famous Wailea Beach) or West Maui, where the sands of Kaanapali Beach and the music from the Old Lahaina Luau are located. But the rest of the island should not be missed. Travel along the Road to Hana to experience East Maui's scenic coastline, explore Haleakala – the world's largest dormant volcano – in the Upcountry and explore the former tribal battlegrounds of Central Maui's Iao Valley State Park.","monthsToVisit":"The best times to visit Maui are April through May and September through November. The spring and fall shoulder seasons provide the pleasant weather Hawaii vacationers seek without the high rates and heavy crowds that accompany the summer and winter. However, if you're into surfing, you'll want to travel in the winter for the best conditions – just book as early as possible to get a discounted rate. Meanwhile, if you're traveling with kids, you may want to splurge for a summer trip as that's when the waters are calmest.\n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":"Maui is a great place to go if you're looking to learn more about Hawaii history and culture. In fact, legend has it that it was the demigod, Maui, who pulled the islands from the sea and lassoed the sun from the top of Haleakala. Travelers who are interested in learning more about island lore will have plenty of opportunities to do so: A visit to the scenic Iao Valley will offer a glimpse into the tumultuous era of tribal warfare, while a stroll through the small town of Lahaina will yield a better understanding of Hawaii's whaling, plantation and trade history.\nToday, Maui is one of America's most popular vacation destinations – probably because it's so drastically different from any place on the mainland. Vacationers will find all the makings of contemporary luxury at the island's resorts, but outside the hotel areas, the relaxed \"Aloha spirit\" permeates. If you're looking to blend in with the locals, you simply need to loosen up: Pack T-shirts, shorts and flip-flops (as well as some light layers) for everyday wear and tone down the road rage (no honking here).\nFolklore still plays a large role in day-to-day life, with residents paying tribute to various gods and goddesses in a number of ways – most notably hula dancing. Although visitors to the island see hula performances as entertainment, they are also a type of prayer and should be respected.\nOther cultural traditions continue to influence everyday life in Maui, one of the most noticeable being language. Unlike many other states, Hawaii has two official languages: English and Hawaiian, which is a member of the Polynesian language family. Though you won't have any trouble finding English-speakers, you'll benefit from learning a few basic Hawaiian phrases; \"aloha\" means both \"hello\" and \"goodbye,\" and \"mahalo\" means \"thank you.\"\nThe arts are a mainstay on the island, with numerous festivals – like the one held twice a month in Lahaina's Banyan Tree Park – showcasing works by regional craftspeople. And throughout the year, Maui honors its vibrant culture through events like the Maui Steel Guitar Festival and the East Maui Taro Festival (both held in April).\nIf you're more interested in discovering Maui's natural wonders than its heritage, you'll find plenty of places to do so – from flower-filled jungles to underwater reefs teeming with aquatic life. However, it's important that you leave the island as you found it. Resist the urge to collect living souvenirs or to have a one-on-one encounter with local wildlife, as these could result in hefty fines or even jail time. "},{"title":"Sydney","link":"/Sydney_Australia/","subtitle":"#3 in Best Places to Visit in Australia and The Pacific","description":"Sydney is both a laid-back beachside town and a thriving metropolis that boasts some of the Southern Hemisphere's best surf, landmarks and activities.

Even Sydneysiders have an ideal mix of both worlds: Fashion-forward attire and British-style sarcasm combine with a \"no worries\" attitude and relaxed coastal vibe. It's no wonder this vibrant city down under is a natural choice for first-time Aussie visitors.\nIn addition to tons of beaches and top-notch restaurants and bars, Australia's most populous city features an array of things to do. Thrill-seekers can participate in heart-pounding activities like a Sydney Harbour Bridge climb, while visitors looking to unwind will appreciate a relaxing day at Coogee or Manly Beach or a peaceful stroll through the Royal Botanic Garden. There's also plenty of seasonal Sydney festivals and events to experience, such as Sculpture by the Sea, the Festival of the Winds and the Night Noodle Markets. Whether you're looking to enjoy a rugby match, hit up the city's museums or lounge on a beach, Sydney's got you covered.","monthsToVisit":"The best times to visit Sydney are September through November and from March to May. These months skirt Sydney's high and low seasons, offering visitors comfortable temperatures and manageable tourist crowds. Plus, airline prices fall during these shoulder seasons, making it more affordable to visit in the spring and fall. Thanks to Australia's location in the Southern Hemisphere, Sydney's warmest weather and peak tourist season falls between December and February (America's winter).

However, much like their British counterparts, Aussies are known for their sarcasm and frank remarks. Vulgar language is the norm throughout Australia, so those who take offense to cursing may not want to visit Sydney. But, if you can move past Sydneysiders' lewd lingo, navigating this Australian city is relatively easy, thanks to the country's use of English. Try brushing up on your Aussie slang, though, before arriving. Key phrases to know are \"fair dinkum\" (true or genuine), \"g'day\" (hello) and \"I reckon\" (for sure). And like other major cities, keep a close eye on your belongings, especially in tourist areas where pickpockets are known to target foreigners.\nAlso, keep in mind Australia's driving culture. Similar to other former British colonies like South Africa, Guyana and India, Aussies drive on the left side of the road. As a result, pedestrians should look to the right, then the left and then right again before crossing the street. Visitors traveling by taxi should also note that tips are not required. Many cab drivers, though, will try coercing customers into providing a tip; refrain from providing gratuity when getting around by taxi. Tips are also not required when dining out at restaurants unless exceptional service is provided.\nAll Australian cities, including Sydney, use the Australian dollar (1 Australian dollar is equal to $0.72).

Or both?\" And foreigners have a good reason to ask them. This territory, made of multiple islands, returned to China's possession in 1997 after more than a hundred years of British occupation. Upon its reunification with China, Hong Kong added certain stipulations that provide a unique degree of autonomy. For instance, the official currency remains the Hong Kong dollar (HKD); English and Chinese are the official languages; and the tiny nation has an independent judiciary system. In short, China and Hong Kong observe a \"one country, two systems\" policy that can have many foreigners scratching their heads. But don't question it. Just accept it and enjoy everything this territory has to offer.\nHong Kong distinguishes itself from its Chinese brethren like Shanghai and Beijing with its vibrant, multifaceted culture and stunning cityscape. This British-Chinese hybrid astounds visitors with its striking juxtaposition of dense skyscrapers and lush landscapes. From sandy beaches to rugby pitches, there's more fresh air than most travelers suspect. And, of course, as a world-class metropolis, Hong Kong boasts numerous urban diversions, such as culinary hot spots and museums. After visiting Hong Kong, the only question you might be asking is: \"Why didn't I get here sooner?\"","monthsToVisit":"The best time to visit Hong Kong is between October and December.

American travelers who have visited other Chinese cities like Beijing will notice a much stronger Western influence in the urban landscape, array of food choices, social practices (like greeting with a handshake) and more English speakers. These familiar aspects and the ease of getting around greatly reduce the culture shock that visitors usually experience upon entering China.\nYou should note that the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD) is much weaker than the United States Dollar (USD).

And some Florence attractions are closed an additional day a week (besides Sunday), so research attractions' hours before making your itinerary.\nIn comparison to the United States, Italians have a less strict sense of personal space. Do not be surprised if they go further than a handshake at first meetings. Cheek-to-cheek and mouth-to-cheek kisses are not unusual. Follow their lead and note: Reciprocation is bella figura; to pull away would be rude. Speaking of rude, you should avoid pointing with your index finger, as most Italians point using all four fingers. And never point at something with just your index and pinky together; it's considered vulgar.\nFinally, Florence's official currency is the euro. Since the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates, be sure to check what the current exchange rate is before you go.

Divers should plan a trip for winter or spring – the summer is the absolute worst time for visibility underwater – and sailors should try to visit in March, during the BVI Spring Regatta.\n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":"The British Virgin Islands comprise four larger islands – Tortola, Anegada, Virgin Gorda, and Jost Van Dyke – and 50-some smaller islands and cays. They're a British overseas territory, and as such its culture is a mix of European, Caribbean and African facets. Often called \"the Sailing Capital of the World,\" boating is a popular pastime in BVI. Football (or soccer) and cricket are other popular sports, which hail from the BVI's English heritage. \nThe official currency of the British Virgin Islands is the dollar, and travelers will need a lot of them on a BVI vacation. \nVirgin Islanders dress casually but conservatively. Wearing a bathing suit – or even sandals – anywhere besides the beach marks you as a tourist. Most nightclubs are willing to accept you in boat shoes and a nice pair of shorts, but don't be surprised to find the residents in slightly better attire."},{"title":"Costa Rica","link":"/Costa_Rica/","subtitle":"#3 in Best Places to Visit in January","description":"To many, Costa Rica's charm lies in its lush rainforests, unspoiled beaches and abundance of wildlife. With breathtaking landscapes and a myriad of creatures – from toucans to monkeys to jaguars – it's easy to see why. Where else can you hike active volcanoes, zip line through cloud-covered rainforests and surf warm turquoise waters within the span of just a few days? In this compact but diverse tropical paradise, exhilarating outdoor activities are abundant. Nature-seekers will roam thick jungles while beachgoers will sprawl across the powdery sands. It's hard not to admire all the splendors this \"Rich Coast\" has to offer.\nHowever, for others, this small Latin American country has a different appeal: it's a relaxed way of life. Residents – known as Ticos – often recite the catchphrase \"pura vida\" (or \"pure life\"). This guiding philosophy can be observed from Costa Rica's central cosmopolitan capital of San José all the way to the sandy Atlantic and Pacific coasts. To truly immerse yourself in the good life, kick back and admire the awe-inspiring scenery. Surround yourself with graceful butterflies at La Paz Waterfall Gardens, hike along the monumental Arenal Volcano, mingle with locals at Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, or simply sit in a hammock under a palm tree along the Nicoya Peninsula. We have a strong feeling you'll discover the pure life, too.","monthsToVisit":"The best time to visit Costa Rica is from mid-December to April (the dry season). This peak tourist season boasts plenty of sunshine making it an ideal time for exploring rainforests and lounging on beaches. That said, the dry season is the most popular (and expensive) time to visit. Luckily the U.S. dollar goes a long way in Costa Rica no matter the season. You'll have to book your room and tour reservations three months in advance to secure a spot. If you don't mind getting a little wet, visit between May and November when prices are at their lowest. During June and July, rain showers pause briefly, and Costa Rica's forests burst with green foliage.While planning your trip, keep in mind that the weather varies by region. In the thick forests of the Caribbean Sea coast and Northern Plains, expect high humidity and temperatures ranging between the 70s and high 80s year-round. Conversely, in the North Pacific, prepare for lower humidity levels, but temperatures that often soar into the 90s during Costa Rica's dry months.\n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":"Costa Rican residents (los Costarricenses or \"Ticos\") are known for their pleasant and easygoing nature. Always warm, welcoming and living life to the fullest, Ticos often greet each other with a hearty \"Pura Vida!\" (meaning \"pure life\"). Don't be alarmed by their benevolence and eagerness to please guests. To blend in, just reciprocate with kindness and embrace their positive philosophy.\nThe official language here is Spanish; however, you'll find English-speakers in popular tourist areas. But using some key phrases, such as \"por favor\" (\"please\") and \"gracias\" (\"thank you\"), is a polite gesture that goes a long way.\nDressing in casual clothing coincides with the laid-back Costa Rican lifestyle. You'll want to pack loose fitting clothing and sturdy hiking shoes if you're planning to explore the country's rustic wildlife reserves, volcanoes and parks. You'll also want to lather up with sunscreen and insect repellent, as mosquitoes and other critters swarm Costa Rica's damp rainforests.\nCoffee beans are commonly associated with the \"Gold Coast.\" You're also likely to spot coffee plantations in the Central Plains; many travelers enjoy taking tours here. However, high-end coffee beans are hard to come by since they are commonly exported rather than sold locally.\nCosta Rica's official currency is the Costa Rica Colón (CRC). Since the CRC to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates, be sure to check what the exchange rate is before you go. Major credit cards are accepted at most restaurants and shops. \nAs far as dining goes, travelers should note that restaurants add gratuity onto the bill. However, tipping extra is not uncommon; if the service is stellar, leave an additional tip. For tour guides and drivers, plan to dole out about $10 per day.\nCosta Rica's official religion is Catholicism. More than 70 percent of Costa Rica's population identifies as Catholic; however, the Catholic Church's presence is not readily visible to the unsuspecting traveler, except during patron saint celebrations when locals flock to the streets outside churches for dancing, music and scrumptious cuisine.\nIn Costa Rica, you'll face few safety concerns. However, in congested San José, you'll want to keep an eye on your belongings and your rental car. Pickpocketing and car theft are common in heavily trafficked tourist areas.  "},{"title":"Bali","link":"/Bali_Indonesia/","subtitle":"#2 in Best Places to Visit in April","description":"Shangri-La, Elysium, Arcadia, Utopia and Bali are all synonymous with \"heaven.\" The only difference between them is that you can actually visit Bali. Many travelers have never been to this Indonesian island. Yet, the word \"Bali\" conjures daydreams of the most fantastical landscape: towering volcanoes wrapped in a deep green canopy, sandy shores that fade into turquoise waters and curving coastlines crowned with staggered pagodas. And believe it or not, Bali rarely disappoints.\nYou'll be amazed at how many different types of visitors revel in this paradise. The ordinary traveler simply stays at the palatial oceanfront resort and indulges in luxurious spa treatments, decadent cuisine and lazy sunbathing. But the historian will find his or her delights at the island's many temples while the adventurer will discover new paths up an active volcano in Kintamani. Plus, the town of Kuta boasts more riotous pleasures for those inclined to late nights. Bali is a dream come true, so wake up and book your ticket.","monthsToVisit":"The best time to visit Bali is between April and October, the island's dry season. Bali experiences only two seasons: the rainy season and the dry season. Throughout the year, the daytime temps hover between the mid-80s and low 90s, with only the humidity and precipitation patterns changing. The lack of rain during the summer season makes Bali more comfortable for beachgoers.\n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":"Bali is a part of Indonesia; for this reason, the official (and dominant) language is Indonesian. However, you'll still hear Balinese (a Malayo-Polynesian language) being spoken by some locals. Because international tourism plays a key role in Bali's economy, English is widely spoken in larger towns and cities. That means you shouldn't have a problem getting around, purchasing souvenirs or ordering food.\nThe currency in Bali is the Indonesian rupiah. Since the rupiah to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates, be sure to check what the current exchange rate is before you go. Also, keep in mind that because the large numerical difference can be confusing for foreigners, locals sometimes ask for unreasonable prices and can trick travelers into coughing up more cash than they need to. For reference, $1 is equal to approximately 14,330 rupiah.\nIn terms of religion, Bali is unique among the Indonesian islands, which are mostly Islamic. Hinduism is the predominant religion in Bali. Most of the temples found here are sacred Hindu sites, so be respectful of the customs you'll witness, such as praying in pools of water. To get a sense for the island's unique religion, don't miss a visit to Bali's temples."},{"title":"St. Lucia","link":"/St_Lucia/","subtitle":"#1 in Best Caribbean Honeymoons","description":"Lush, unspoiled St. Lucia has a growing fan base. Some of its vacationers are music lovers, letting loose at the springtime St. Lucia Jazz & Arts Festival, or adrenaline junkies, testing their limits climbing The Pitons or zip lining through the Chassin region's rain forest. Others are honeymooners, unwinding on one of the island's chalky beaches or holing up in one of its isolated resorts.\nBut what if you don't fall into any of these categories? Don't worry: St. Lucia refuses to be pigeonholed as any \"type\" of Caribbean vacation. Plus, you also don't have to spend a lot of money (its reputation as a luxurious hideout is only somewhat warranted). To discover some of the island's indescribable charms, you'll have to visit for yourself. Start your mornings basking in an orange-tinted Soufrière sunrise then round out your evenings at an evening \"jump-up\" (or dance party) along Gros Islet. ","monthsToVisit":"The best time to visit St. Lucia is between May and June. These late spring and early summer months offer wonderful weather – high 70s to 80s – plus there are enviable room rates at the best hotels. Music lovers should consider visiting in early May specifically to attend the St. Lucia Jazz & Arts Festival that's held at Pigeon Island National Landmark. The island is flush with activity in the summer and late fall, but there's a greater chance of hurricanes. The busiest and most expensive time to vacation is from December to April, the driest season.\n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":""},{"title":"Great Barrier Reef","link":"/Great_Barrier_Reef_Australia/","subtitle":"#1 in Best Adventure Vacations in Australia and the Pacific","description":"As one of the original Seven Natural Wonders of the World, the Great Barrier Reef holds a spot on every traveler's bucket list. Hugging the east coast of Queensland, Australia, the Great Barrier Reef extends from Cape York in the north all the way to Bundaberg in the south – more than 1,800 miles. With roughly 2,900 coral reefs, 600 islands and 1,500-plus species of fish, the reef leaves its 2 million annual visitors enchanted.\nBut before diving in, it's important to get your bearings. The northern part of the reef runs from the Cape York Peninsula to Cairns, a popular home base for many reef visitors. Not only does Cairns provide the closest reef access from the mainland, but it also boasts a few attractions of its own, such as the Kuranda Scenic Railway and the Cairns Botanic Gardens. Other sights like Hartley's Crocodile Adventures and the Wildlife Habitat Port Douglas are also situated by the reef's northernmost section. Travel farther down the coast and you'll run into the central part of the reef, which includes Townsville and the Whitsunday Islands, where Hamilton Island and Whitehaven Beach reside. And between the Capricorn Coast (along the Tropic of Capricorn) and Fraser Island, you'll find Airlie Beach and the only section of reef that has not been impacted by severe coral bleaching events.\nWherever you decide to hang your hat, the Great Barrier Reef is a treasure trove of once-in-a-lifetime experiences. Whether you're gazing at marine life through a scuba mask, letting the tropical breeze unfurl your sail or taking in the reef from a plane, the possibilities for exploration are nearly limitless.","monthsToVisit":"The best time to visit the Great Barrier Reef is from June to October. This peak season offers some key advantages for travelers. Temperatures hover in the low 60s to mid-80s, and rainfall is uncommon, which means clearer waters and better diving conditions. Along with the ideal weather, these winter and spring months offer cheaper prices at hotels near the central and southern parts of the reef, but keep in mind that accommodations and diving excursions in Cairns tend to fill up quickly due to the influx of tourists to the region. Meanwhile, the area's low season (known locally as the wet or stinger season) takes place between November and May and brings more rain, resulting in poorer water visibility and an abundance of deadly box jellyfish.\n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":"Protecting the Great Barrier Reef and all its inhabitants is as much a part of the region's culture as it is the law. For Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (two indigenous ethnic groups), the Great Barrier Reef is home to significant cultural and spiritual sites, meaning respect for the land is essential. More than 70 Aborigine and Torres Strait Islander Traditional Owner groups are situated along the Queensland coast, from the northern Torres Strait Islands to southern Bundaberg. Because each group values the land for different reasons, be it cultural, spiritual, economic or social, it's important for visitors to follow responsible reef practices.\nBy being mindful of your environment, you can avoid some of the common dangers associated with exploring the Great Barrier Reef. If you're swimming or diving near the Queensland mainland during the reef's rainy season (November through May), be aware of deadly box jellyfish – wear a stinger or Lycra wetsuit to avoid any jellyfish stings. And always remember that you're entering an animal's natural habitat, so try not to disturb its environment. Also, keep in mind that it's against the law to damage or collect coral, alive or not. But that's not the only reason you should avoid coral's sharp polyps: Cuts can quickly turn into infections due to the Great Barrier Reef's thermal climate.\nWhen you're not sporting your wetsuit, feel free to embrace the region's casual seaside disposition by wearing loose, comfortable clothing (and don't forget the SPF!). While you won't have to worry about a language barrier here (English is the primary language), Aussies are known for their sarcasm and using slang terms like \"g'day\" (hello), \"ripper\" (great) and \"reckon\" (for sure), so study your Aussie slang before arriving. Another thing to keep in mind: The official currency is the Australian dollar, which is roughly equivalent to $0.74, and tips are not given unless exceptional service is provided. And remember, Aussies calculate distances in kilometers and drive on the left side of the road, so you should look right, then left and then right again before crossing the street."},{"title":"Banff","link":"/Banff_Canada/","subtitle":"#2 in Best Places to Visit in Canada","description":"If you're itching to experience the lifestyle of a Swiss skiing village, but don't want to fork over the cash for a trans-Atlantic flight, consider Banff. Thanks to its location in the heart of the Canadian Rockies near the southeastern border of Banff National Park – Canada's first national park – taking trips here will decrease not only your flight time from the U.S. but also your expenses (although only marginally). Banff caters to intrepid explorers who prefer to end the day in a nice hotel rather than roughing it at the campgrounds (though, there are plenty of those, too). Opportunities for adventure abound, so pick your sport: Ski down Mount Norquay, hike to the massive, free-standing limestone pillars known as the Hoodoos, \"scramble\" up the face of the Stoney Squaw Mountain or bike along Healy Creek. When you are exhausted, retreat to your cozy (and warm) resort, and replenish yourself with a hefty helping of bison meat.","monthsToVisit":"The best times to visit Banff are June to August and December to March. Nature lovers will want to get to the park when the weather is warm and welcoming (and while the hotel rates in town are at a reasonable level). The skiers, however, will want to vacation in the height of winter. Depending on what you want to do, Banff can be seen as an almost year-round destination (although fall can be a bit of a gamble). Temperatures fluctuate dramatically throughout the year; average winter temperatures range from the single digits to the low 30s. During the summer, average temperatures range from 40 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. No matter when you choose to visit, plan to wear sunglasses, a hat and plenty of sunscreen to protect against UV exposure: The sun at these alpine altitudes is strong.\n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":"Banff residents are generally friendly to tourists. Feel free to ask for help or directions.\nDuring the day, dress is casual, especially if you're planning to spend most of your time skiing or exploring the park. It is common to see hiking attire in restaurants during lunch. However, if you are planning to go to dinner, it's best to bring slightly dressier attire. Make sure you bring warm clothing, particularly during the winter. Consider packing layers for summer trips as the temperature tends to fluctuate.\nThe Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates; plan to check it before your trip. Most hotels and restaurants accept major credit cards. Similar to the U.S., an average tip is 15 percent. Taxicab drivers, tour guides and hotel bellmen are accustomed to being tipped about 10 percent, too.

During these months, crowds are largely gone and temperatures are the most comfortable, with highs in the 70s and 80s. Though summer may sound like the ideal option, both domestic and international travelers flock to the tiny towns that line the Amalfi Coast, subsequently taking up tons of space. Winter travel is a great for scoring a deal, but it's also when cafes and restaurants close up shop for the season. The autumn months following September are another recommended time to visit, as day temperatures are still relatively warm. \n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":"Being one big UNESCO World Heritage site, the Amalfi Coast is brimming with culture. Each town offers its own special story. Amalfi is the country's oldest maritime republic and the center of the coast's once thriving paper business. Positano served as the choice destination for the rich and famous, including Picasso, Steinbeck and Elizabeth Taylor. Meanwhile, Minori is the birthplace of one of the oldest pastas in the world, Ndunderi. \nResidents here speak Italian, but depending where you are, there may be regional dialect differences. When greeting other Italians in a social situation, shake hands. Greeting with a kiss or two on the cheek is common between Italians, but only if they know one another. Those not proficient in Italian needn't worry about getting too lost in translation. The Amalfi Coast sees about 5 million total visitors per year. While that pales in comparison to other Italian hotspots (Florence sees 16 million per year, Venice sees 70,000 per day), that doesn't mean English-speakers are few and far between. You can expect to encounter English-speaking Italians around popular attractions, restaurants in tourist areas, as well as hotels. Positano and Amalfi in particular have the most hotels and restaurants of any other town in the Amalfi Coast, so if you intend to go just there, you're not likely to encounter many barriers. However, the smaller towns that line the coast may pose issues. When in doubt, seek out younger Italians, as they are required to start learning English in school at age six. Key phrases to know are \"si\" (yes), \"grazie\" (thank you), \"mi scusi\" (pardon me), \"Parla inglese?\" (Do you speak English?) and \"Dov'e la toilette?\" (Where is the bathroom?).  \nIn Amalfi, restaurants are normally open from 12:30 to 3 p.m. for lunch and 7:30 to 11:30 p.m. for dinner. Locals, however, tend to eat lunch later in the afternoon at 1:30 and dinner at 9 p.m. Keep in mind: Service moves a little slower here. If you find yourself in more traditional establishments, don't expect servers to bring you the check unless specifically requested. Tipping is not common in Italy; instead, restaurants usually add a service charge upward of 12 percent. However, if you really enjoyed your meal or service, an extra 10 percent will suffice. \n\nBeing one big UNESCO World Heritage site, the Amalfi Coast is brimming with culture.

But its picturesque downtown veils both a dark legacy and a resilient past. Dating back to about A.D. 870, Prague has withstood numerous overthrows, invasions, fires and floods. It's this reputation for survival and perseverance that has made the Czech capital so fascinating. Today, its storied churches, narrow streets, daunting hilltop castle and statue-lined bridges create the scene of an urban fairy tale. Even the most jaded traveler would have trouble resisting this city's charms.\nPrague was once a hidden gem, overshadowed by its flashier neighbors to the west. But the city couldn't keep its marvels a secret for too long – now, it's a haven for travelers seeking awe-inspiring experiences at affordable prices. Even today, top attractions – including the famous Charles Bridge and the historic Prague Castle – offer free admission and many hotels offer rooms at a fraction of the cost of other European cities. But this bargain-hunting legacy has a ticking clock on it, so if you're hoping to find a fire-sale price, now's the time to do so.","monthsToVisit":"The best times to visit Prague are the spring and early fall when the weather is mild and there are fewer crowds. Because of the city's generally chilly climate, the warmer summer months (average high temperatures hover in the low to mid-70s) see the largest influx of tourists – which means higher hotel rates. The spring and early fall, however, offer clear skies, highs ranging from the mid-50s to the upper 60s and much lower room rates. Prague also shines during the festive Christmas season but be warned that the city sees a fair amount of snow and highs don't rise above the mid-30s. \n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":"The Czech Republic is a Parliamentary Republic that was established in 1993 following the Cold War. But Prague and the Czech state have been important centers of business, government and commerce for centuries. Czech citizens are known for being more formal and reserved than some other European cultures yet friendly, too. In many Prague bars and restaurants, groups can share tables if there is room, even if they don't know each other. After eating, be sure to place your fork and knife side by side on your plate if you want the waiter to take your plate away.\nThe Czech Republic uses the koruna and major credit cards are accepted at most establishments throughout Prague. Since the koruna to U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuates, be sure to check what the current exchange rate is before you go. Tipping 10 to 15 percent is common practice for good service, but be mindful to hand it directly to your server instead of leaving it on the table. Like many European destinations, local Prague citizens respond kindly to travelers who try the local Czech language, so buy a phrase book before traveling. Some helpful phases such as thank you (D?kuji), excuse me (S dovolením) and even do you speak English (Mluvíte anglicky?) will come in handy. "},{"title":"Maldives","link":"/Maldives/","subtitle":"#2 in Best Places to Visit in Asia","description":"You've seen photos of the Maldives before: picture-perfect private villas suspended over striking blue waters, alabaster white sand beaches and spectacular sunsets dipping into the horizon. The scenic beauty of the Maldives is something to behold, something you can't quite understand until you're there in person.\nThe island nation of the Maldives is popular with honeymooners looking for seclusion and adventurers looking to explore the depths of the sea on a scuba diving and snorkeling excursion. Travelers seeking relaxation can unwind at one of the island spas and all visitors should certainly spend a day exploring the Maldivian capital of Male'. However, getting to and staying in this tropical paradise requires patience (there are no direct flights from the United States) and plentiful cash. Located between the Arabian and Laccadive seas, roughly 500 miles southwest of Sri Lanka, the Maldives is about as isolated as you can get – and that's just another one of its many allures.","monthsToVisit":"The best time to visit the Maldives is from November to April. The island nation is warm and sunny year-round, but consists of a dry season and a wet, rainy season. There are pros and cons to visiting in each season. Travelers will experience the best weather in the Maldives between November and April, thanks to little precipitation and warm temperatures. Unfortunately, this is also the busiest time of year and, as such, the room rates at resorts are expensive. However, since each resort inhabits its own island, you won't have to contend with throngs of crowds like you might during the high season in another destination. May to October is considered the rainy season, with the islands seeing between 5 and 10 inches of precipitation monthly and often strong winds. Visitors will likely find better deals for this time of year (though, the term \"deal\" is relative, since the Maldives is a pricey location year-round). This time of year is popular with surfers, though, because the area sees bigger waves and better swells for surfing during these months.\n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":"The Maldives has been an Islamic nation since the 12th century. With this rich heritage, you'll find religious traditions entrenched in the culture. Mosques dot the capital of Male', and you’ll see some men and women dressed in very conservative attire. Should you wish to visit a mosque, you too should dress accordingly; however, be aware that some mosques are closed to non-Muslims. You'll also notice people praying in public at certain times throughout the day. Be respectful by lowering your voice and not walking in front of those who are praying. Most of these visible cultural and religious traditions have been extracted from the resorts. However, particularly during Ramadan, expect to witness some Islamic customs, such as local restaurants closing for the daytime when the population will be fasting. \nPublic displays of affection, such as kissing or hand-holding, are illegal. Alcohol is illegal, too, though it is available and can be consumed on resort islands. Homosexuality is also illegal in this island nation. Men and women should be dressed conservatively when traveling to and from the airport, and throughout Male' and Hulhumale'. \nWith dozens of resort islands, the Maldives relies on tourism as its dominant industry that draws on a large portion of the workforce. The other major industry is fishing, and this island nation exports its sea catches to countries across the world. The Maldivian currency is the rufiyaa and $1 equals about 15 rufiyaas. However, the exchange rate can fluctuate so be sure to check it before you travel.\nThe official language of the Maldives is Dhivehi though many Maldivians speak and understand English, especially those working at high-end resorts."},{"title":"San Francisco","link":"/San_Francisco_CA/","subtitle":"#1 in Best California Vacations","description":"A jumbled collage of colorful neighborhoods and beautiful views, San Francisco draws those free-spirited types who have an eye for edgy art, a taste for imaginative cuisine and a zeal for adventure. It's really not surprising that songwriter Tony Bennett left his heart here: The city boasts jaw-dropping sights, world-class cuisine, cozy cafes and plenty of booming nightlife venues – there's no shortage of ways to stay busy here. Spend an hour or two sunning yourself alongside sea lions on the bay, admiring the views of the city from Twin Peaks, or strolling along the Marina. And for the quintessential San Franciscan experience, enjoy a ride on a cable car.\nOften described as Los Angeles' more refined northern cousin, cool and compact San Francisco takes the big-city buzz exuded by its southern counterpart and melds it with a sense of small-town charm. Here, you'll discover a patchwork of culture flourishing throughout San Francisco's many vibrant quarters. Follow the crowds to the touristy Fisherman's Wharf area (which offers spectacular views of Alcatraz) before heading along the bay to the Presidio for a glimpse of the famous Golden Gate Bridge. But don't forget to save time for the Mission District, the Haight and the Castro for exposure to all of the different varieties of the San Francisco lifestyle.","monthsToVisit":"The best time to visit San Francisco is from September to November. Believe it or not, fall offers some of the city's warmest temperatures year-round, not to mention fewer crowds than summer. Spring is another good time to visit thanks to its mild temperatures and lack of rain (compared to other parts of California). The Golden Gate City witnesses a surge in tourism during the summer as people head west in search of sun, sand and surf. However, the fluctuating climate can quickly trounce a day at the beach. Those looking for the perfect seaside getaway should consider a trip to Los Angeles where the sunshine lasts year-round. Meanwhile, winter in San Francisco draws bargain-hunters with the promise of lower hotel rates and fewer people. If you decide to travel in the wintertime, protect yourself from the chilly temperatures with plenty of layers.\n                                Data sourced from the National Climatic Data Center\n                            ","cultureCustoms":"San Francisco is one of the most progressive cities in the United   States, with historical ties to the hippie and gay rights movements. The city is also among the most diverse in the United States, with distinct Hispanic, Chinese and European traditions represented in a host of arts and music festivals, as well as an oftentimes grandiose display of architecture.\nTo match its love for progressiveness and diversity, San Francisco also prides itself on its environmental sustainability efforts. Composting is mandatory for all city residents, and the Bay Area remains host to an abundant amount of nonprofit environmental organizations.\nSan Franciscans also love the outdoors, and the city's lush parks (including Golden Gate Park) and proximity to excellent natural wonders (including Yosemite National Park) make it one of the most enviable cities for adventure travelers."}]
